## About 

The Center of Crisis Resolutions is dedicated to promoting Good Governance for personal and social growth. Our Good Ways model is based on the philosophy that anyone can do good things, no matter who they are or where they come from. We use gamification to make learning fun and engaging, preparing individuals to deal with real-world situations.

## Mission and Vision
- Mission: To promote Good Ways without biased prejudgments and through applications of Gamified Good Governance for Individuals and Professionals.
- Vision: To invest in the practice of assertive and kind interactions between individuals, as our good ways bring us together and help us resolve crises.
